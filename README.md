# Completed-Capstone-Project 
## Thinkful Decoder Ring Project: First Capstone Project

## A project to test my ability to build algorithms using Mocha and Chai:

### This application that you are building will help decode different messages.

### These messages are written using Caesar shift, the Polybius square, or a substitution cypher:

### -Caesar shift: A type of substitution cipher, shifting letters to the right or left based on the alphabetical order.

#### Example:

### -Polybius square: A cipher that arranges the alphabet in a grid, when trying to decode the message, every pair of numbers represents a specific letter.

#### Example:

### -Substitution cipher: There is a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet, the recipient of the code must have the substitution alphabet in order to be able to decode the secret message.
